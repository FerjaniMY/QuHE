### QuHE: Open source library for quantum homomorphic encryption
- ![image](./img/QFHE.png)


### Project Description: 

Quantum computers will tackle problems in different fields such as medical research and finance, where the protection of sensitive data is a must. But quantum computers on the cloud can be threaten for security, particulary when delegating a potential data to such computers. .Clients, with limited computational ability, will want to use the services offered by quantum computation and communication protocols, in a way that their privacy is guarantee.

 Fully homomorphic encryption enables arbitrary computation on encrypted data without decryption.  Similarly to classical HE, quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE) allows clients with limited computational ability to delegated computations to untrusted quantum servers.

This project, we developed QuHE, a library for quantum homomorphic enryption using Qiskit in which we implement some quantum homomorphic encryption protocols to allow the quantum computer to compute on encrypted data. Then, we provide quantum search on encrypted data as an application of the implemented library
